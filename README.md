`enpls` offers an algorithmic framework for measuring feature importance, outlier detection, model applicability domain evaluation, and ensemble predictive modeling with (sparse) partial least squares regressions.

## Installation

Install `enpls` from CRAN:

```r
install.packages("enpls")
```

Or try the development version on GitHub:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("road2stat/enpls")
```

See [the vignette](https://enpls.org/doc/) (or open with `vignette("enpls")` in R) for a quick-start guide.
